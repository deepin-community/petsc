 1. You are free to use this program and/or to redistribute           
    this program.                                                     
 2. You are free to modify this program for your own use,             
    including commercial use, subject to the publication              
    restrictions in item 3.                                           
 3. You are free to publish results obtained from running this        
    program, or from works that you derive from this program,         
    with the following limitations:                                   
    3a. In order to be referred to as "STREAM benchmark results",     
        published results must be in conformance to the STREAM        
        Run Rules, (briefly reviewed below) published at              
        http://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/ref.html                    
        and incorporated herein by reference.                         
        As the copyright holder, John McCalpin retains the            
        right to determine conformity with the Run Rules.             
    3b. Results based on modified source code or on runs not in       
        accordance with the STREAM Run Rules must be clearly          
        labelled whenever they are published.  Examples of            
        proper labelling include:                                     
        "tuned STREAM benchmark results"                              
        "based on a variant of the STREAM benchmark code"             
        Other comparable, clear and reasonable labelling is           
        acceptable.                                                   
    3c. Submission of results to the STREAM benchmark web site        
        is encouraged, but not required.                              
 4. Use of this program or creation of derived works based on this    
    program constitutes acceptance of these licensing restrictions.   
 5. Absolutely no warranty is expressed or implied.
