# ISColoringType
determines if the coloring is for the entire parallel grid/graph/matrix or for just the local ghosted portion 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscis.h" 
typedef enum {
  IS_COLORING_GLOBAL,
  IS_COLORING_LOCAL
} ISColoringType;
```


```none
`IS_COLORING_GLOBAL` - does not include the colors for ghost points, this is used when the function
```
```none
is called synchronously in parallel. This requires generating a "parallel coloring".
```
```none
`IS_COLORING_LOCAL` - includes colors for ghost points, this is used when the function can be called
```
```none
separately on individual processes with the ghost points already filled in. Does not
```
```none
require a "parallel coloring", rather each process colors its local + ghost part.
```
```none
Using this can result in much less parallel communication. Currently only works
```
```none
with DMDA and if you call MatFDColoringSetFunction() with the local function.
```
