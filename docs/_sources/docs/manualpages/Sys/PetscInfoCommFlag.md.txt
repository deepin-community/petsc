# PetscInfoCommFlag
Describes the method by which to filter `PetscInfo()` by communicator size 
## Synopsis
```
typedef enum {
  PETSC_INFO_COMM_ALL       = -1,
  PETSC_INFO_COMM_NO_SELF   = 0,
  PETSC_INFO_COMM_ONLY_SELF = 1
} PetscInfoCommFlag;
```
Used as an input for `PetscInfoSetFilterCommSelf()`


- ***`PETSC_INFO_COMM_ALL` -*** Default uninitialized value. `PetscInfo()` will not filter based on
communicator size (i.e. will print for all communicators)
- ***`PETSC_INFO_COMM_NO_SELF` -*** `PetscInfo()` will NOT print for communicators with size = 1 (i.e. *_COMM_SELF)
- ***`PETSC_INFO_COMM_ONLY_SELF` -*** `PetscInfo()` will ONLY print for communicators with size = 1
