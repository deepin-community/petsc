# PetscMallocClear
Resets the routines used to do mallocs and frees to the defaults. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscsys.h"   
PetscErrorCode PetscMallocClear(void)
```
Not Collective




## Note
In general one should never run a PETSc program with different malloc() and
free() settings for different parts; this is because one NEVER wants to
free() an address that was malloced by a different memory management system

Called in `PetscFinalize()` so that if `PetscInitialize()` is called again it starts with a fresh slate of allocation information


## See Also
 `PetscMallocSet`
