# PetscStreamType
Stream blocking mode, indicates how a stream implementation will interact with the default "NULL" stream, which is usually blocking. 
## Synopsis
```
#include <petscdevicetypes.h> 
typedef enum {
  PETSC_STREAM_GLOBAL_BLOCKING,
  PETSC_STREAM_DEFAULT_BLOCKING,
  PETSC_STREAM_GLOBAL_NONBLOCKING,
  PETSC_STREAM_MAX
} PetscStreamType;
```
```none
PETSC_STREAM_GLOBAL_BLOCKING    - Alias for NULL stream. Any stream of this type will block the host for all other streams to finish work before starting its operations.
```
```none
PETSC_STREAM_DEFAULT_BLOCKING   - Stream will act independent of other streams, but will still be blocked by actions on the NULL stream.
```
```none
PETSC_STREAM_GLOBAL_NONBLOCKING - Stream is truly asynchronous, and is blocked by nothing, not even the NULL stream.
```
```none
PETSC_STREAM_MAX                - Always 1 greater than the largest PetscStreamType, do not use
```
