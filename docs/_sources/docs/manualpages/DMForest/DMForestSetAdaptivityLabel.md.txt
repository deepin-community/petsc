# DMForestSetAdaptivityLabel
During the pre-setup phase, set the label of the pre-adaptation forest (see DMForestGetAdaptivityForest()) that holds the adaptation flags (refinement, coarsening, or some combination).  The interpretation of the label values is up to the subtype of DMForest, but DM_ADAPT_DETERMINE, DM_ADAPT_KEEP, DM_ADAPT_REFINE, and DM_ADAPT_COARSEN have been reserved as choices that should be accepted by all subtypes.
