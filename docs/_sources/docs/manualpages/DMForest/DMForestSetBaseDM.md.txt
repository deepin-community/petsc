# DMForestSetBaseDM
During the pre-setup phase, set the DM that defines the base mesh of a DMForest forest.  The forest will be hierarchically refined from the base, and all refinements/coarsenings of the forest will share its base.  In general, two forest must share a base to be comparable, to do things like construct interpolators.
