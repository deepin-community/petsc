# DMForestSetCellWeights
Set the weights assigned to each of the cells (see DMForestGetCellChart()) of the current process: weights are used to determine parallel partitioning.  Partitions will be created so that each process's ratio of weight to capacity (see DMForestSetWeightCapacity()) is roughly equal. If NULL, each cell receives a weight of 1. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscdmforest.h" 
#include "petscdm.h" 
#include "petscdmlabel.h" 
PetscErrorCode DMForestSetCellWeights(DM dm, PetscReal weights[], PetscCopyMode copyMode)
```
Logically collective on dm


## Input Parameters

- ***dm -*** the forest
- ***weights -*** the array of weights for all cells, or NULL to indicate each cell has weight 1.
- ***copyMode -*** how weights should reference weights
