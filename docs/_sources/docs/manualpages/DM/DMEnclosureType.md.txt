# DMEnclosureType
The type of enclosure relation between one `DM` and another 
## Synopsis
```
typedef enum {
  DM_ENC_EQUALITY,
  DM_ENC_SUPERMESH,
  DM_ENC_SUBMESH,
  DM_ENC_NONE,
  DM_ENC_UNKNOWN
} DMEnclosureType;
```



## Notes
For example, one `DM` dmA may be the boundary of another dmB, in which case it would be labeled `DM_ENC_SUBMESH`.

If the situation is reversed, and dmA has boundary dmB, it would be labeled `DM_ENC_SUPERMESH`.

Likewise, if dmA was a subregion of dmB, it would be labeled `DM_ENC_SUBMESH`.

If no relation can be determined, `DM_ENC_NONE` is used.

If a relation is not yet known, then `DM_ENC_UNKNOWN` is used.
