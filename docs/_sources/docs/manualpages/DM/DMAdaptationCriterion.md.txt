# DMAdaptationCriterion
Describes the test used to decide whether to coarsen or refine parts of the mesh 
## Synopsis
```
typedef enum {
  DM_ADAPTATION_NONE,
  DM_ADAPTATION_REFINE,
  DM_ADAPTATION_LABEL,
  DM_ADAPTATION_METRIC
} DMAdaptationCriterion;
```


`DM_ADAPTATION_REFINE` will uniformly refine a mesh, much like grid sequencing. `DM_ADAPTATION_LABEL` will adapt
the mesh based upon a label of the cells filled with `DMAdaptFlag` markers. `DM_ADAPTATION_METRIC` will try to
mesh the manifold described by the input metric tensor uniformly. PETSc can also construct such a metric based
upon an input primal or a gradient field.
