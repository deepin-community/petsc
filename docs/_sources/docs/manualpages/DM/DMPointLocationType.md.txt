# DMPointLocationType
Describes the method to handle point location failure 
## Synopsis
```
typedef enum {
  DM_POINTLOCATION_NONE,
  DM_POINTLOCATION_NEAREST,
  DM_POINTLOCATION_REMOVE
} DMPointLocationType;
```


If a search using `DM_POINTLOCATION_NONE` fails, the failure is signaled with a negative cell number. On the
other hand, if `DM_POINTLOCATION_NEAREST` is used, on failure, the (approximate) nearest point in the mesh is
used, replacing the given point in the input vector. `DM_POINTLOCATION_REMOVE` returns values only for points
which were located.
