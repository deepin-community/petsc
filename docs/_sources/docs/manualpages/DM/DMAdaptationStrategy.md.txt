# DMAdaptationStrategy
Describes the strategy used for adaptive solves 
## Synopsis
```
typedef enum {
  DM_ADAPTATION_INITIAL,
  DM_ADAPTATION_SEQUENTIAL,
  DM_ADAPTATION_MULTILEVEL
} DMAdaptationStrategy;
```


DM_ADAPTATION_INITIAL will refine a mesh based on an initial guess. DM_ADAPTATION_SEQUENTIAL will refine the
mesh based on a sequence of solves, much like grid sequencing. DM_ADAPTATION_MULTILEVEL will use the sequence
of constructed meshes in a multilevel solve, much like the Systematic Upscaling of Brandt.
