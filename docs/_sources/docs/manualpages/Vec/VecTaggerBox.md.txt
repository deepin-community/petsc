# VecTaggerBox
A box range used to tag values.  For real scalars, this is just a closed interval; for complex scalars, the box is the closed region in the complex plane such that real(min) <= real(z) <= real(max) and imag(min) <= imag(z) <= imag(max).  INF is an acceptable endpoint. 
## Synopsis
```
typedef struct {
  PetscScalar min;
  PetscScalar max;
} VecTaggerBox;
```
