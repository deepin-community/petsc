# MATBAIJMKL
MATBAIJMKL = "BAIJMKL" - A matrix type to be used for sparse matrices. This matrix type is identical to `MATSEQBAIJMKL` when constructed with a single process communicator,
and `MATMPIBAIJMKL` otherwise.  As a result, for single process communicators,
`MatSeqBAIJSetPreallocation()` is supported, and similarly `MatMPIBAIJSetPreallocation()` is supported
for communicators controlling multiple processes.  It is recommended that you call both of
the above preallocation routines for simplicity.


## Options Database Keys
