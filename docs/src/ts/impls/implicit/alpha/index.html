# Time-steppers for ODE and DAE - TS Manual Pages

<A HREF="../../../../../src/ts/tutorials/index.html">Examples</A><BR>

The time-stepping (TS) component provides ODE and DAE integrators as well as
pseudo-timestepping.  TS internally
employs <A HREF="../../../../../docs/manualpages/SNES/index.html">SNES</A> to solve the nonlinear
problems at each time step (except for the Sundials functions, which
use nonlinear solvers within Sundials).

TS users can also set SNES options directly in application codes by first extracting the SNES context from the TS context via
<A HREF="../../../../../docs/manualpages/TS/TSGetSNES.html">TSGetSNES()</A>
and then directly calling various SNES (and KSP and PC with further unwrapping) routines (e.g.,
<A HREF="../../../../../docs/manualpages/PC/PCSetType.html">PCSetType()</A>
).
