# Data Management (DM)

`DM` objects are used to manage communication between the algebraic structures in PETSc (`Vec` and `Mat`) and mesh data structures
in PDE-based (or other) simulations. See, for structured grids `DMDA`, for staggered grids `DMSTAG`, and for unstructured grids `DMPLEX`.
Users guide chapter: [](part_dm).
